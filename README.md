The app will calculate how far (in metres) a thunder is from you. All you have to do is inserting the distance between the lighting (light) and the thunder (sound) in seconds.

The current design of the app has been made with free online tools or the Corona Simulator.

There are currently two possible logos for the app, but one of them is much more likely to be the definitive one than the other.

Open to any kind of collaboration, we are also looking for designers to improve the app graphics and create the definitive logo. 

On the main repository there is an .html file with the main links to the Fulmen Project and my contacs.

New features we would like to implement into some new beta versions:
- getting the results in miles, to give an easier User Experience also in USA, Liberia and Myanmar
- inserting the seconds in decimal numbers to get a more accurate result, for the nerds ;) 
- receiving curios information about thunderstorms and guides to follow when you are in a thunderstorm
- creating some .JSON files to store the user datas to track all the thunder that he saw and registered
- creating SQL tables to store better the sentencse to print with the .lua code and updating them more easily
