New Android App: Fulmen

The app will calculate how far (in metres) a thunder is from you. All you have to do is inserting the distance between the lighting (light) and the thunder (sound) in seconds.
We would like to implement some new features in the new beta versions, like:
- distance in miles;
- possibility to write seconds in decimal for a more accurate result.
