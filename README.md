# Fulmen
Current Version: v0.1.4.3-beta

Written in Lua with Solar2d Engine

Programmed entirely by FrankPujo

The app will calculate how far (in metres) a thunder is from you. All you have to do is inserting the distance between the lighting (light) and the thunder (sound) in seconds.

The very smple algorithm is based on the speed of sound, which is 343.1 metres per second. The speed of light is not considered, because it would be almost irrelevant in the final result.

The other main feature of the app will be a randomized feed of information about thunders.

An SQL table will help managing these sentences better.

Also we would like to let the user store his recorded thunders through a JSON file.

We will soon implement the possibility to get the results in miles, to give an improved UX in the countries using the imperial system of units (USA, Liberia and Myanmar).

The current design of the app has been made with free online tools or the Corona Simulator.

Open to any kind of collaboration, we are also looking for designers to improve the app graphics and create the definitive logo.

On the main repository there is an html file with the main links to the Fulmen Project and my profiles.

We are considering adding a "nerd" settings. Thi will admit decimal inputs and will give more detailed results.

We currently have 4 possible logos, two will probably will be discarded.

One logo will probably become the App Icon. The other one will be used for a name-logo.
