Current Version: v0.1.3.1-beta

Written in Lua with Solar2d Engine

The app will calculate how far (in metres) a thunder is from you. All you have to do is inserting the distance between the lighting (light) and the thunder (sound) in seconds. We would like to implement some new features in the new beta versions, like getting the results in miles, inserting the seconds in decimal numbers to get a more accurate result and, most importantly, receiving curios information about thunderstorms and guides to follow when you are in a thunderstorm.

We are looking forward to create SQL tables to store the datas and to keep update faster the printing sentences of the .lua code.

The current design of the app and the logo have been made with free online tools or the Corona Simulator.

Open to any kind of collaboration.
