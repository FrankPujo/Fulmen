The app will calculate how far (in metres) a thunder is from you. All you have to do is inserting the distance between the lighting (light) and the thunder (sound) in seconds. We would like to implement some new features in the new beta versions, like getting the results in miles, inserting the seconds in decimal numbers to get a more accurate result and, most importantly, receiving curios informations about thunderstorms and guides to follow when you are in a thunderstorm.
